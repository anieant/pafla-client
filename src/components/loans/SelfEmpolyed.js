                                            Yes, it is possible for a self-employed to avail a personal loan without
                                            income
                                            proof. I am sure, now you must be curious to know how? So, let me tell you
                                            that
                                            though income proof is important as far as availing a loan is concerned, but
                                            in
                                            some cases, a loan can also be given to self-employed individuals if they
                                            fail
                                            to submit the proof. In that case, the lenders usually offer the secured
                                            personal loan to the applicants by mortgaging their property documents. A
                                            borrower needs to submit his/her property documents to the lender so as to
                                            get
                                            the funds instantly via a secured personal loan.
