                                        Yes, it is possible for a self-employed to avail a personal loan without income
                                        proof. I am sure, now you must be curious to know how? So, let me tell you that
                                        though income proof is important as far as availing a loan is concerned, but in
                                        some cases, a loan can also be given to self-employed individuals if they fail
                                        to submit the proof. In that case, the lenders usually offer the secured
                                        personal loan to the applicants by mortgaging their property documents. A
                                        borrower needs to submit his/her property documents to the lender so as to get
                                        the funds instantly via a secured personal loan.
